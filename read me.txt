Clustering method:
Using stations geo-information to do Kmeans clustering

Kmeans:
We will utilize KMeans function from pyspark.ml.clustering --> Parameters: k (Number of clusters)

Elbow Method:
The Elbow method is a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within cluster analysis designed to help finding the appropriate number of clusters in a dataset. This method looks at the percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters: One should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster doesn’t give much better modeling of the data.

Observations & comparisons:
In my clustering code, I observed that with 2 clusters, I can have the best silhouette value which is a criterion for evaluating the performance of the clustering we've applied.
